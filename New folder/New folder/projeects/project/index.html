                            <h2> Tee Vachiramon, CEO of SERTIS Co.,Ltd.</h2><p> We had our company annual offsite at Royal Cliff in Pattaya. Royal Cliff was the perfect choice for us: there are multiple large event spaces for various activities and the great staff made sure the events went smoothly. The hotel food was also of a very high quality with an impressive choice at breakfast. Combined with a stunning view of the sea and a private beach, we couldn’t have asked for a better place for our company. Thank you for making our trip so special. </p>                      </div>

                     <h2>Pimvilai Noenmai, Human Resources Officer of SERTIS Co.,Ltd.</h2><p> On behalf of Sertis Co.,Ltd, we thank you very much for your hospitality during our company trip and sports day 2020 last week on 2-4 October 2020. Absolutely everything went like a charm.

                        The hospitality and services provided by each staff of the hotel were excellent, they attended us well at all times and we were impressed by their courtesy. We enjoyed our stay and convey thanks to all associated with the hotel. Special thanks to Khun Gap, who took very good care of our group since the inspection day until the end of the trip. We really appreciate ka. We hope to come again soon.
                        
                        Thanks for the memories!</p>

                      <h2> Kelly Bunyan WFN & SFN Managing Director</h2>
                      <p> I recently held two conferences at the Royal Cliff Beach Hotel (April 2017).

                        Over the past 14 years, I’ve hosted conferences in every continent worldwide.
                        
                        The Royal Cliff Resort is an excellent choice for anybody considering hosting their events there. Top level facilities and excellent staff make for a brilliant environment within which to operate.
                        
                        The hotel is meticulous in its planning, providing excellent décor, signage and the like. Importantly, they never seemed to tire of the constant emails from an equally meticulous event manager. Always prompt and attentive.
                        
                        Particularly, Ruchika Longani and Danaithep Chanhom were excellent in their roles. They and their team managed both events with the utmost professionalism. Highly competent and skilled, they were a pleasure to work with.
                        
                        I recommend Royal Cliff Resort to anybody enquiring.
